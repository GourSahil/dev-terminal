# 🖥️ Dev-Terminal

**Dev-Terminal** is a web-based project that emulates a Linux-style terminal interface to present developer portfolio information in an interactive and minimal way.

Instead of traditional UI cards or pages, users interact with a terminal-like environment to explore data, commands, and content — making the portfolio feel more authentic, technical, and engaging.

## Build Test
**Build Test** is the branch where every commit is going to be deployed on Render at [dev-terminal.onrender](https://dev-terminal.onrender.com).
**Contributors** can commit the things to this branch when they want to test that how they things will be seen on real deployed web by commiting the chages to this branch.

## ✨ Key Features

- Linux terminal–inspired UI
- Command-based interaction
- Clean separation of frontend and backend
- JSON-based data flow
- Designed for extensibility and collaboration

## 🛠️ Technical Overview

- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Data Exchange:** JSON APIs
- **Frontend:** Custom terminal-style UI (HTML/CSS/JS)

The backend exposes structured data from an PostgreSQL database via REST-like endpoints.  
The frontend consumes this data and renders it dynamically inside a terminal emulator interface.
